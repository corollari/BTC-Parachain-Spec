Staked Relayers
===============

The :ref:`staked-relayers` module is responsible for handling the registration and staking of Staked Relayers. 
It also exposes functions for Staked Relayers to vote on Parachain state updates. 


Overview
~~~~~~~~

**Staked Relayers** are collateralized Parachain participants, whose main role it is to run Bitcoin full nodes and check that:
    
    1. Transactional data is available for submitted Bitcoin block headers (``NO_DATA_BTC_RELAY: 0`` code).
    2. Submitted blocks are valid under Bitcoin's consensus rules  (``INVALID_BTC_RELAY: 1`` code).
    3. Vaults do not move BTC to another Bitcoin address, unless expressly requested during :ref:`redeem-protocol` or :ref:`replace-protocol`.
    4. If a Vault is under-collateralized, i.e., the collateral rate has fallen below ``LiquidationCollateralThreshold``, as defined in :ref:`vault-registry`. 

 If one of the above failures is detected, Staked Relayers file a report with the :ref:`security` module. In cases (1) and (2), a vote is initiated, whereby this module acts as bulleting board and collects Staked Relayer signatures - if a majority is reached, as defined by ``STAKED_RELAYER_VOTE_THRESHOLD``, the state of the BTC Parachain is updated. In cases (3) and (4) a single Staked Relayer report suffices - the Security module checks if the accusation against the Vault is correct, and if yes updates the BTC Parachain state and flags the Vault according to the reported failure.


Staked Relayers are overseen by the Parachain **Governance Mechanism**. 
The Governance Mechanism also votes on critical changes to the architecture or unexpected failures, e.g. hard forks or detected 51% attacks (if a fork exceeds the specified security parameter *k*, see `Security Parameter k <https://interlay.gitlab.io/polkabtc-spec/btcrelay-spec/security_performance/security.html#security-parameter-k>`_.). 



Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Enums
------

ProposalStatus
...............

Indicated the state of a proposed ``StatusUpdate``.

* ``PENDING: 0`` - this ``StatusUpdate`` is current under review and is being voted upon.

* ``ACCEPTED: 1``- this ``StatusUpdate`` has been accepted.

* ``REJECTED: 2`` -this ``StatusUpdate`` has been rejected.

*Substrate*

  enum ProposalStatus {
        PENDING = 0,
        ACCEPTED = 1,
        REJECTED = 2,
  }


Structs
--------

StatusUpdate
.............

Struct providing information for an occurred halting of BTC-Relay. Contains the following fields.

======================  ==============  ============================================
Parameter               Type            Description
======================  ==============  ============================================
``newStatusCode``       StatusCode      New status of the BTC Parachain.
``oldStatusCode``       StatusCode      Previous status of the BTC Parachain.
``addErrors``           Set<ErrorCode>  If ``newStatusCode`` is ``Error``, specifies which errors are to be added to the BTC Parachain``Errors``.         
``removeErrors``        Set<ErrorCode>  Indicates which ``ErrorCode`` entries are to be removed from ``Errors`` (recovery).           
``time``                U256            Parachain block number at which this status update was suggested.
``proposalStatus``      ProposalStatus  Status of the proposed status update. See ``ProposalStatus``.
``msg``                 String          Message providing more details on the change of status (detailed error message or recovery reason). 
``btcBlockHash``        H256            Block hash of the Bitcoin block where the error was detected, if related to BTC-Relay.
``votesYes``            Set<AccountId>  Set of accounts which have voted FOR this status update. This can be either Staked Relayers or the Governance Mechanism. Checks are performed depending on the type of status change. Should maintain insertion order to allow checking who proposed this update (at index ``0``). 
``votesNo``             Set<AccountId>  Set of accounts which have voted AGAINST this status update. 
======================  ==============  ============================================

.. note:: ``StatusUpdates`` executed by the Governance Mechanism are not voted upon by Staked Relayers (hence ``votesNo`` will be empty).

5. Return.

.. _voteOnStatusUpdate: 

voteOnStatusUpdate
----------------------

A Staked Relayer casts a vote on a suggested ``StatusUpdate``.
Checks the threshold of votes and executes / cancels a StatusUpdate depending on the threshold reached.
 
.. warning:: This function can only be called by Staked Relayers. The Governance Mechanism can change the ``ParachainStatus`` using :ref:`executeStatusUpdate` directly.


Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``voteOnStatusUpdate(stakedRelayer, statusUpdateId, vote)``

*Parameters*

* * ``stakedRelayer``: The AccountId of the Staked Relayer casting the vote.
* ``statusUpdateId``: Identifier of the ``StatusUpdate`` voted upon in ``StatusUpdates``.
* ``vote``: ``True`` or ``False``, depending on whether the Staked Relayer agrees or disagrees with the suggested suggestStatusUpdate.

*Returns*

* ``None``

*Events*

* ``VoteOnStatusUpdate(statusUpdateId, stakedRelayer, vote)``: emit an event informing about the vote (``vote``) cast by a ``stakedRelayer`` on a ``StatusUpdate``  with the specified identifier (``statusUpdateId``).

*Errors*

* ``ERR_STATUS_UPDATE_NOT_FOUND = "No StatusUpdate found with given identifier"``: No ``StatusUpdate`` with the given ``statusUpdateId`` exists in ``StatusUpdates``.

*Substrate* ::found

  fn voteOnStatusUpdate(origin, statusUpdateId: U256, vote: bool) -> Result {...}


Function Sequence
.................

1. Check if the caller of the function is a Staked Relayer in ``StakedRelayers``. Return ``ERR_STAKED_RELAYERS_ONLY`` if this check fails.

2. Retrieve the ``StatusUpdate`` from ``StatusUpdates`` using ``statusUpdateId``. Return ``ERR_STATUS_UPDATE_NOT_FOUND`` if this check fails.

3. Register the vote:

   a. If ``vote == True``: add ``stakedRelayer`` to ``StatusUpdate.voteYes``. Check if the ``stakedRelayer`` is also included in ``StatusUpdate.voteNo`` (i.e., previously voted "No") and if this is the case, remove the entry - i.e., the Staked Relayer changed vote.

   b. If ``vote == False``: add ``stakedRelayer`` to ``StatusUpdate.voteNo``. Check if the ``stakedRelayer`` is also included in ``StatusUpdate.voteYes`` (i.e., previously voted "Yes") and if this is the case, remove the entry - i.e., the Staked Relayer changed vote.

.. attention:: This ensures a Staked Relayer cannot cast two conflicting votes on the same ``StatusUpdate``. 

4a. Check if the "Yes" votes exceed the necessary ``STAKED_RELAYER_VOTE_THRESHOLD``, i.e., check if ``StatusUpdate.voteYes.length * 100 / StakedRelayers.length`` exceeds ``STAKED_RELAYER_VOTE_THRESHOLD``. If this is the case, call :ref:`executeStatusUpdate`, passing ``statusUpdateId`` as parameter.

4b. Otherwise, check if the ``StatusUpdate`` has been rejected. For this ``(StatusUpdate.voteNo.length *100 / StakedRelayers.length`` exceeds ``100 - STAKED_RELAYER_VOTE_THRESHOLD`` (i.e., ``STAKED_RELAYER_VOTE_THRESHOLD`` can no longer be reached by the "Yes" votes). If this is the case, call :ref:`rejectStatusUpdate` passing ``statusUpdateId`` as parameter

5. Return.

.. note:: We do not automatically slash Staked Relayers who voted against a majority. This is left for the Governance Mechanism to decide and execute manually via :ref:`slashStakedRelayer`.

.. _executeStatusUpdate:

executeStatusUpdate
--------------------

Executes a ``StatusUpdate`` that has received sufficient "Yes" votes.

.. warning:: This function can only be called internally if a ``StatusUpdate`` has received more votes than required by ``STAKED_RELAYER_VOTE_THRESHOLD``.

.. _reportVaultTheft:

reportVaultTheft
-----------------

A Staked Relayer reports misbehavior by a Vault, providing a fraud proof (malicious Bitcoin transaction and the corresponding transaction inclusion proof). 

A Vault is not allowed to move BTC from its Bitcoin address (as specified by ``Vault.btcAddress``, except in the following three cases:

   1) The Vault is executing a :ref:`redeem-protocol`. In this case, we can link the transaction to a ``RedeemRequest`` and check the correct recipient. 
   2) The Vault is executing a :ref:`replace-protocol`. In this case, we can link the transaction to a ``ReplaceRequest`` and check the correct recipient. 
   3) [Optional] The Vault is "merging" multiple UTXOs it controls into a single / multiple UTXOs it controls, e.g. for maintenance. In this case, the recipient address of all outputs (``P2PKH`` / ``P2WPKH``) must be the same Vault. 

In all other cases, the Vault is considered to have stolen the BTC.

This function checks if the Vault actually misbehaved (i.e., makes sure that the provided transaction is not one of the above valid cases) and automatically liquidates the Vault (i.e., triggers :ref:`redeem-protocol`).

.. note:: Status updates triggered by this function require no Staked Relayer vote, as the report can be programmatically verified by the BTC Parachain.

Function Sequence
.................

1. Check that the caller of this function is indeed a Staked Relayer. Return ``ERR_STAKED_RELAYERS_ONLY`` if this check fails.

2. Check if the specified ``vault`` exists in ``Vaults`` in :ref:`vault-registry`. Return ``ERR_VAULT_NOT_FOUND`` if there is no Vault with the specified account identifier.

3. Check if this ``vault`` is already being liquidated, i.e., is in the ``LiquidationList``. If this is the case, return ``ERR_ALREADY_LIQUIDATED`` (no point in duplicate reporting).

4. Check if the given Bitcoin transaction is already associated with an entry in ``TheftReports`` (use ``txId`` as key for lookup). If yes, check if the specified ``vault`` is already listed in the associated set of Vaults. If the Vault is already in the set, return ``ERR_ALREADY_REPORTED``. 

5. Extract the ``outputs`` from ``rawTx`` using :ref:`extractOutputs`.

6. Check if the transaction is a "migration" of UTXOs to the same Vault. For each output, in the extracted ``outputs``, extract the recipient Bitcoin address (using :ref:`extractOutputAddress`). 

   a) If one of the extracted Bitcoin addresses does not match the Bitcoin address of the accused ``vault`` (``Vault.btcAddress``) **continue to step 7**. 

   b) If all extracted addresses match the Bitcoin address of the accused ``vault`` (``Vault.btcAddress``), abort and return ``ERR_VALID_MERGE_TRANSACTION``.

7. Check if the transaction is part of a valid :ref:`redeem-protocol` or :ref:`replace-protocol` process. 

  a) Extract the OP_RETURN value from the (second) output (``outputs[1]``) using :ref:`extractOPRETURN`. If this call returns an error (not a valid OP_RETURN output, hence not valid :ref:`redeem-protocol` or :ref:`replace-protocol` process), **continue to step 8**. 

  c) Check if the extracted OP_RETURN value matches any ``redeemId`` in ``RedeemRequest`` (in ``RedeemRequests`` in :ref:`redeem-protocol`) or any ``replaceId`` in ``ReplaceRequest`` (in ``RedeemRequests`` in :ref:`redeem-protocol`) entries *associated with this Vault*. If no match is found, **continue to step 8**.

  d) Otherwise, if an associated ``RedeemRequest``  or ``ReplaceRequest`` was found: extract the value (using :ref:`extractOutputValue`) and recipient Bitcoin address (using :ref:`extractOutputAddress`) from the first output (``outputs[0]``). Next, check 
     
     i ) if the value is it is equal (or greater) than ``paymentValue`` in the ``RedeemRequest``  or ``ReplaceRequest``. 
     
     ii ) if the recipient Bitcoin address matches the recipient specified in the ``RedeemRequest``  or ``ReplaceRequest``.

    If both checks are successful, abort and return ``ERR_VALID_REDEEM_OR_REPLACE``. Otherwise, **continue to step 8**.

8. The Vault misbehaved (displaced BTC). 

    a) Call :ref:`liquidateVault`, liquidating the Vault and transferring all of its balances and DOT collateral to th ``LiquidationVault`` for failure and reimbursement handling;

    b) set ``ParachainStatus = ERROR`` and add ``LIQUIDATION`` to ``Errors``,

    c) emit ``ExecuteStatusUpdate(ParachainStatus, [LIQUIDATION], [], "Vault 'vault' displaced BTC and is being liquidated")``
